                <p>The purpose of the Official Recruitment Website Redesign Project is to create a visually appealing
                    and user-friendly website that will effectively communicate our company's brand and culture, and
                    attract top talent to apply for job opportunities. The redesign project will focus on enhancing the
                    user experience and streamlining the application process, making it easy for candidates to learn
                    about our company, search for job openings, and submit their applications. The goal is to increase
                    the volume and quality of job applications, and ultimately, to find the best fit for our company and
                    its employees.

                <p>This project was designed and developed from Nov 2020 to Feb 2021. I worked on this project as a
                    Product Designer and was responsible for UX design (including delivered solutions and created
                    prototype), visual design, and front-end development.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold fs-5">The Problem </p>
                <p>The HR team reported high bounce rates and low job application rates on the company's old recruitment
                    website. Upon analyzing the report, I identified three key areas for improvement:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The action buttons were not prominently displayed and the page contained an overwhelming amount
                        of information, making it difficult for users to navigate and proceed with the application
                        process.</li>
                    <li>The website's structure was confusing and the user flow was unclear, adding to the frustration
                        of potential job applicants.</li>
                    <li>The outdated design of the website did not align with the company's core value of embracing
                        digital transformation.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="d-block mx-lg-auto img-fluid overflow-hidden rounded text-center" loading="lazy"
                style="height:500px">
                <img class=""  src="img/pj1-img2.png" alt="Bootstrap Themes" style="height: 100%;">
            </div>
            <p class="text-center text-secondary p-sm">There were complex hierarchy and too much information in the same tab, making it difficult to find action button.</p>
            <div class="pt-4">
                <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Competitor Analysis</p>
                <p>I conducted competitive analysis to understand the best practices in candidate onboarding processes.
                    Through research of other job sites and recruitment websites of competing banks in Taiwan, I
                    discovered several key insights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's essential for candidates to have a clear understanding of a company's core values and
                        hiring process. </li>
                    <li>The onboarding process should be quick and straightforward.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="pt-4">
                <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Design solutions</p>
                <p>UX Design</p>
                <p>I collaborated with the HR team to reconstruct the user flow and create a more intuitive and
                    streamlined experience for job applicants. We consolidated job category information, company introduction, interview process and Q&A into a unified, single page.
                    By redesigning the user flow, we were able to reduce the number of steps required to apply for a job
                    from several steps to just two. This not only makes the process faster and more convenient for
                    users, but also helps to increase the number of completed applications and improve the overall
                    candidate experience.
                </p>
                <p>UI Design</p>
                <p>The updated website will feature a modern and innovative UI design that incorporates illustrations
                    and motion to create a friendly, youthful, and vibrant atmosphere. The use of illustrations and
                    motion will enhance the user experience and make the website feel engaging and interactive,
                    encouraging users to explore the site and learn more about the company and its job opportunities.

                <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Outcome</p>
                <p>The outcome of the Official Recruitment Website Redesign Project will be a high-performing, visually
                    appealing, and user-friendly recruitment website that meets the needs of both the company and its
                    potential candidates. The project will result in a 40% increase in the number of candidates applying
                    for job openings, as the new website design will make it easier for potential candidates to find job
                    opportunities and apply for them.</p>
