                <p>The purpose of the Official Recruitment Website Redesign Project is to create a visually appealing
                    and user-friendly website that effectively communicate the company's brand and culture, and
                    attract top talent to apply for job opportunities. The project focused on enhancing the
                    user experience and streamlining the application process, making it easy for candidates to learn
                    about the company, search for job openings, and submit their applications. The goal is to increase
                    the volume and quality of job applications, and ultimately, to find the best fit for the company and
                    its employees.

                <p class="fw-bold fs-5">The Problem </p>
                <p>The HR team reported high bounce rates and low job application rates on the company's old recruitment
                    website. Upon analyzing the report, I identified three key areas for improvement:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The action buttons were not prominently displayed and the page contained an overwhelming amount
                        of information, making it difficult for users to navigate and proceed with the application
                        process.</li>
                    <li>The website's structure was confusing and the user flow was unclear, adding to the frustration
                        of potential job applicants.</li>
                    <li>The outdated design of the website did not align with the company's core value of embracing
                        digital transformation.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="d-block mx-lg-auto img-fluid overflow-hidden rounded text-center project-detail--img"
                loading="lazy">
                <img class="" src="img/pj1-img2.png" alt="Bootstrap Themes">
            </div>
            <p class="text-center text-secondary p-sm">The old website had a complex hierarchy. For example, there was an
                overwhelming
                amount of information in recruitment page, which made users feel lost and unsure of where to begin.</p>
            <div class="pt-4">
                <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Competitor Analysis</p>
                <p>I conducted competitive analysis to understand the best practices in candidate onboarding processes.
                    Through research of other job sites and recruitment websites of competing banks in Taiwan, I
                    discovered several key insights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's essential for candidates to have a clear understanding of a company's core values and
                        hiring process. </li>
                    <li>The onboarding process should be quick and straightforward.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="pt-4">
                <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Design solutions</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>UX Design</li>
                    <p>I collaborated closely with the HR team to thoroughly analyze the existing job application
                        process and identify pain points for users. Through this analysis, I recommended simplifying the
                        hierarchy to only two levels and suggested that HR reserve important pieces of information
                        for job applicants. We then consolidated job category information, company introduction,
                        interview process, and Q&A into a unified, single page, which was designed to be intuitive and
                        streamlined. By redesigning the user flow and making it more straightforward, we were able to
                        reduce the number of steps required to apply for a job from several steps to just three, which
                        has resulted in a faster and more convenient process for users.

                    <p>The updated website will feature a modern and innovative UI design that incorporates
                        illustrations
                        and motion to create a friendly, youthful, and vibrant atmosphere. The use of illustrations and
                        motion will enhance the user experience and make the website feel engaging and interactive,
                        encouraging users to explore the site and learn more about the company and its job
                        opportunities.
                        To ensure ease of use, clear and prominent action buttons have been added throughout the site,
                        guiding users towards their desired action.

                        Official Recruitment Website</a> was lunched on Feb 2021. The project resulted in a 40% increase
                    in the number of candidates applying
                    for job openings, as the new website design made it easier for potential candidates to find job
                    opportunities and apply for them. The outcome of it is a high-performing, visually appealing, and
                    user-friendly recruitment website that meets the needs of both the company and its
                    potential candidates. </p>
