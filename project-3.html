                <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Overview</p>
                <p>The Design System Establishing Project was a crucial step in creating a cohesive and unified design language for our company, enabling us to deliver more consistent and high-quality user experiences across all of our products and services. Ultimately, this will lead to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and business success for the bank.

                <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Goal</p>
                <p>The goal is to establish a comprehensive design system that provides a cohesive and consistent experience across all of the bank's digital products and services. This system should include a set of guidelines, patterns, and reusable components that ensure visual and functional consistency and improve the efficiency and speed of design and development.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Challenge</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Resistance to change: Banks are often known for their traditional and conservative approach to design and branding. Introducing a new design system may face resistance from employees who are accustomed to the existing brand guidelines.</li>
                <li>Coordination and collaboration: Design systems often require coordination and collaboration among various teams, including product teams, design teams, and engineering teams. In a large organization like a bank, coordinating these teams and ensuring effective collaboration can be a complex process. It is important to gather input and feedback from different teams to arrive at the best and balanced solutions.</li>
                <li>Integration with legacy systems: Banks often have complex legacy systems in place, which may be challenging to integrate with a new design system. This may require additional development resources and careful planning to ensure a smooth transition.</li>
                <li>Regulatory compliance: Banks are subject to strict regulatory compliance requirements, which may impact the design system. The design system needs to meet regulatory requirements and ensure the security and privacy of customer data.</li>
                <li>Accessibility: Banks must ensure that their digital products and services are accessible to all customers, including those with disabilities. Design systems must take into account accessibility standards and ensure that the user interface is designed to be accessible and easy to use for everyone.</li>
              </ul>

                <p class="fw-bold fs-5">What we do</p>
                <p>We held a design system workshop and involved a wide range of stakeholders from various departments to brainstorm and establish a set of design principles that aligned with the company's image of "integrity, professional, and vibrant." In order to ensure that the resulting design system would be cohesive and consistent, we made a point to refer back to these principles whenever there were disagreements or challenges during the design process. By checking to see whether potential solutions matched or deviated from our agreed-upon design principles, we were able to maintain alignment and balance the needs and perspectives of all stakeholders involved in the project.

                <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Outcome</p>
                <p>By establishing a design system, the bank can improve the user experience, streamline internal processes, reduce costs, and maintain brand consistency across all its digital channels.</p>
