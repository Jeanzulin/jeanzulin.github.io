                <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Overview</p>
                <p>In response to the digital
                    transformation of the banking industry and the need to avoid social contact during the COVID-19, our
                    company recognized the need to improve the online bank account opening process. To simplify and
                    streamline the process for customers, we proposed an improvement project that enables them to open
                    multiple accounts, including stocks, savings, and credit cards, through a single, easy-to-use
                    process.

                <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Goal</p>
                <p> With a focus on enhancing the user experience, the project aims to create a
                    process that is intuitive, efficient, and appealing to customers. By offering a quick and convenient
                    way to open multiple accounts, the project will trigger users to take advantage of the full range of
                    financial products offered by the bank, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty,
                    Ultimately, this project will support the bank's digital transformation efforts and help to reduce
                    the workload of physical branches during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                    <p>We collaborate with stakeholders from various departments to gather requirements and insights.
                        Based on the results of our analysis and feedback from stakeholders, we designed a unified form
                        and develop a streamlined process for opening multiple accounts. </p>

                    <li>Analysis of existing processes: The first step is to thoroughly analyze the existing processes
                        for opening stock accounts, savings accounts, and credit cards. This includes identifying user
                        pain points and opportunities for improvement, as well as consolidating redundant information.
                    </li>
                    <li>Competitor Analysis: We evaluated the user-flow, user interface and overall user experience of the account opening
                        processes of several competing banks. </li>
                    <li>Design of the unified form: We will then design a unified form that will gather all the
                        necessary personal information from customers in one place. This form will be optimized for
                        usability, with a focus on making it quick and easy for customers to provide the information
                        needed to open new accounts.</li>
                    <li>Development of the new process: The team will then develop the new, streamlined process for
                        opening multiple accounts, taking into account the results of the analysis and feedback from
                        stakeholders.</li>
                    <li>User testing and iteration: The project team will conduct user testing to gather feedback on the
                        new process and make any necessary improvements. This may involve iterating on the design of the
                        unified form, the user interface, or the underlying process itself.</li>

                    customers to open new accounts, and a corresponding increase in customer satisfaction and engagement
                    with the bank's digital services.</p>
                <p>This propos project team will conduct user testing to gather feedback on the new process and make any
                    necessary improvements. This may involve iterating on the design of the unified form, the user
                    interface, or the underlying process itself.
                    Launch: Once the new process has been thoroughly tested and refined, it will be launched to the
                    public, making it easier and more convenient for customers to open multiple accounts in just one
                    process.
